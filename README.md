# ESPN Fantasy Autopick Chrome Extension

# Bug reports
If the extension isn't working properly, please report a bug on the GitHub page. To help me figure out what the problem is, the following is very helpful:
1. Include screenshots or text that shows your roster and your league settings.
2. Check the developer console in your browser for any error messages.

To check for errors, do the following:
1. Open the developer console by pressing the F12 key, and go to the Console tab.
2. There's a dropdown that sets the log levels. Make sure the "Verbose" level is included so it says "All levels".
3. Clear the log by clicking the Clear button.
4. Click the Auto button added by the extension.
5. The extension should print some debug information to the console. If something goes wrong there may be a red error message or a yellow warning message as well. Either copy the relevant text or take a screenshot that contains all of it.
